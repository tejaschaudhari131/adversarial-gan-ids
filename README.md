# Adversarial GAN for Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)

A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for generating adversarial network traffic to evaluate and challenge deep learning-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).

---

## **Project Overview**

This project develops a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate adversarial network traffic patterns designed to evade detection by a specified deep learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The primary goal is to evaluate the robustness of the IDS model against adversarial attacks and compare the success rate of these attacks with existing known attack techniques (e.g., random or handcrafted attacks). The framework provides insights into the vulnerabilities of deep learning-based IDS and aids in developing stronger, more secure models.

---

## **Motivation**

Deep learning-based IDS models show significant promise in detecting various network attacks, but their performance against adversarial attacks remains a concern. This project aims to explore the vulnerabilities of these models when exposed to adversarial examples and suggests ways to enhance their robustness.

## **Methodology**

* **Target IDS**:  
  The target IDS is a deep learning model trained on network traffic data, specifically designed to detect malicious traffic. This model is based on [], trained on [], which includes both normal and attack traffic. Detailed documentation for the IDS model is included [link to IDS documentation or paper].

* **Dataset Creation**:  
  The dataset consists of [], pre-processed using []. The dataset is split into training and testing subsets, ensuring a balanced mix of normal and attack traffic.

* **GAN Architecture**:  
  The GAN consists of two main components:
  * **Generator**:  
    The generator is responsible for creating adversarial network traffic designed to evade detection. It uses a [] that learns to produce network packets indistinguishable from normal traffic.
  * **Discriminator (IDS mimic)**:  
    The discriminator mimics the behavior of the target IDS. It is a [] model that distinguishes between normal and adversarial traffic. The IDS mimic is trained using a mix of real traffic and adversarial samples generated by the generator.

* **Training Process**:  
  Both the generator and discriminator engage in a zero-sum game:
  * **Loss Function**: The generator minimizes a loss function designed to fool the discriminator (IDS mimic), while the discriminator minimizes a loss function to correctly classify traffic as adversarial or normal.
  * **Optimizer**: Both networks use []. The model is trained for [] on the [dataset name].
  
  Detailed training scripts can be found in the `training/` folder.

* **Evaluation Metrics**:  
  The effectiveness of the adversarial attacks is measured by:
  * **Evasion Rate**: The percentage of adversarial samples successfully bypassing the IDS.
  * **IDS Accuracy**: The accuracy of the IDS model on both original and adversarial test sets. This allows for a direct comparison of the model's baseline performance versus its performance under adversarial attack.

* **Comparison with Other Attacks**:  
  This project compares the GAN-generated attacks with traditional attack methods, such as random or handcrafted attacks, to measure the novelty and effectiveness of adversarial samples.
