# Adversarial GAN for Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)

A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for generating adversarial network traffic to evaluate the robustness of deep learning-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the development of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) designed to generate adversarial network traffic to evade detection by a deep learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The project aims to evaluate how well the IDS performs against these adversarial attacks compared to traditional attack techniques. This helps in identifying weaknesses in IDS models and improving their robustness.

## Motivation

Deep learning-based IDS models have been effective in detecting known network attacks. However, their performance against adversarial examples (network traffic designed to evade detection) remains a significant challenge. This project addresses this issue by creating a GAN to produce adversarial traffic and evaluate the IDS model's resilience.

## Methodology

### Target IDS

The target IDS is a neural network trained on network traffic data for binary classification (normal or attack). The architecture and training procedures are outlined in `models/ids_model.py`.

### Dataset

We use real or simulated network traffic data in CSV format (e.g., `train_data.csv` and `test_data.csv`), which includes both normal traffic and attack patterns. The data is split into training and test sets for evaluating the model's performance.

### Dataset 
Intrusion detection evaluation dataset (CIC-IDS2017) ("https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html")

### GAN Architecture

- **Generator:** A neural network that takes random noise as input and generates synthetic network traffic that resembles normal traffic. The goal is to produce traffic that can fool the IDS into classifying it as benign.
- **Discriminator:** A neural network that attempts to differentiate between real (normal) and generated (adversarial) traffic. This network mimics the IDS model and is trained alongside the generator.

### Training

The generator and discriminator are trained together in an adversarial setup:
- **Generator:** Tries to generate adversarial traffic that can bypass the discriminator (mimicking IDS).
- **Discriminator:** Tries to distinguish real traffic from adversarial traffic.

The IDS model is pre-trained on normal traffic before being attacked with the adversarial traffic generated by the GAN.

### Evaluation

The IDS model is evaluated based on:
- **Evasion Rate:** The percentage of adversarial samples that successfully evade the IDS.
- **Accuracy Comparison:** The accuracy of the IDS on the original (non-adversarial) dataset vs. the adversarial dataset.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
- Required libraries specified in `requirements.txt`

### Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Getting Started

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tejaschaudhari131/adversarial-gan-ids.git
cd adversarial-gan-ids
```

### Training the IDS model

First, train the IDS model on the normal network traffic:

```bash
python training/train_ids.py
```

This script will load the dataset from `data/train_data.csv` and train the IDS model, saving the model in the `models/` directory.

### Training the GAN

Train the GAN (generator and discriminator):

```bash
python training/train_gan.py
```

This script will train the generator to produce adversarial network traffic that can bypass the IDS.

### Evaluating the IDS

After training, you can evaluate the IDS model's performance on adversarial traffic using:

```bash
python evaluation/evaluate_model.py
```

This script will measure the accuracy of the IDS on both normal and adversarial traffic, displaying the evasion rate.

## Results and Findings

- **Evasion Rate:** The GAN-generated adversarial traffic successfully evades the IDS with an average evasion rate of [XX%].
- **Baseline Accuracy:** The accuracy of the IDS on normal traffic was [YY%], while its accuracy dropped to [ZZ%] when tested on adversarial traffic.

## Future Work

1. **Incorporating More Complex Attacks:** Extend the project to include more sophisticated adversarial attack techniques.
2. **Exploring Defense Mechanisms:** Implement and evaluate defense mechanisms like adversarial training or anomaly detection systems.
3. **Different Types of Network Traffic:** Use diverse datasets to test the IDS against varied network conditions.
